#### Making boo-ves with animation

Now that you have your viewer's attention, let's scare them ... with animated jack-o-lanterns!

In the `images` folder, we have a file named [jack1.png](images/jack1.png).  What doesn't say "Boo!" like a smiling jack-o-lantern!  So let's use it.

Add the image to the canvas by adding these lines to the beginning of our javascript code:

```javascript
    var x1 = 0;
    var y1 = 200;
    img1 = new Image();
    img1.src = "images/jack1.png";

```

What?  It's not there... oh, yeah!  We forgot to draw it on the canvas!  Change your `draw()` function so it looks like this:

```javascript
    function draw(context) {
        var lingrad = context.createLinearGradient(0,0,0,400);
        lingrad.addColorStop(0, '#ffa500');
        lingrad.addColorStop(1, '#ffffff');
        context.fillStyle = lingrad;
        context.fillRect (0, 0, 600, 400);
        // Draw our heart
        context.drawImage(img1, x1, y1);
        // Write our message
        counter = counter + 1;
        if (counter > 100) {
            if (alpha < 100) alpha = alpha + 1;
            opacity = alpha / 100;
            context.font = "40px Times New Roman";
            context.fillStyle = "rgba(0, 0, 0," + opacity + "0)";
            context.textAlign = "center";
            context.fillText(myMessage, 300, 200);
        }
```

Okay, now we're cooking with gas!  Are you starting to understand how our functions and variables are working together to create our eCard?  If you have any questions, think of ways to change the code to answer your questions (or use Google if you want to know about specifics of Javascript, jQuery, or HTML5).

What's that you say?  There's no animation yet!?! Well, Mr./Ms. "I-can't-wait-to-read-another-paragraph", try this on for size:

```javascript
    function draw(context) {
        var lingrad = context.createLinearGradient(0,0,0,400);
        lingrad.addColorStop(0, '#ffa500');
        lingrad.addColorStop(1, '#ffffff');
        context.fillStyle = lingrad;
        context.fillRect (0, 0, 600, 400);
        // Draw our heart
        y1 = y1 - 1;
        if (y1 < -300) y1 = 400;
        context.drawImage(img1, x1, y1);
        // Write our message
        counter = counter + 1;
        if (counter > 100) {
            if (alpha < 100) alpha = alpha + 1;
            opacity = alpha / 100;
            context.font = "40px Times New Roman";
            context.fillStyle = "rgba(0, 0, 0," + opacity + "0)";
            context.textAlign = "center";
            context.fillText(myMessage, 300, 200);
        }
```

What did we do?  Now everytime the `draw()` function is called, our `y1` variable decreases by 1.  This will move our jack-o-lantern upwards!

Why?

Well, `<canvas>` is a bit silly (IMHO) - it creates a grid of points and decides that the most important point, the "origin", is the top left corner.  That point is given the value (0,0): zero pixels up/down and zero pixels left/right.

Every other point is named according to it's grid distance from the origin.  So the point (5, 3) is 5 pixels to the right of the origin and 3 pixels down.  So far, so good?  If not, try drawing it out on a sheet of paper with a friend.  It'll soon make sense. ;-)

Can you make the jack-o-lantern fall down?  How about make it go from left --> right?

BONUS: Can you make the jack-o-lantern move in a diagonal?

Repeat this step and add more jack-o-lanterns.  **Hint:** Make small jack-o-lanterns move slower and large jack-o-lanterns faster to give the illusion of depth to your card!  Also, put the `context.drawImage()` for the small jack-o-lanterns _before_ the big jack-o-lanterns so the small ones don't look like they're in front.
